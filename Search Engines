Search Engines

The Principle Of Search Engines?

In search engines, there are two main functions. 

The first is to collect information from the Internet and process it by placing it in the data warehouse in a form 
that will be convenient for searching for information by criteria.

The second is to provide information to the user on request, which is the most relevant content of his search. 
This means that useful sites will be on top, and so on in descending order.

How is text mining different from using a search engine?

Search engines are powerful tools that make huge quantities of information available to us. However, 
the level of text analysis a search engine uses when crawling the web is basic compared to the way 
text analytics tools and text mining techniques work.

Rather than looking for keywords and other signals of quality and relevance as search engines do, a text mining algorithm 
can parse and assess every word of a piece of content, often working in multiple languages. 

Text mining algorithms may also take into account semantic and syntactic features of language to draw conclusions about
the topic, the authorâ€™s emotions, and their intent in writing or speaking.
